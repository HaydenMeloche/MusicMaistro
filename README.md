# MusicMaistro Discord Bot
MusicMaistro is a Discord musicbot, another one...  
But it show the songs & the queue in a special way, it puts the songs more in the spotlight.

---
You can invite the bot [here](http://polliedev.com/MusicMaistro).
It should send a message to the server owner. In case you are not the server owner you can request the information through `->info`.
The initial setup is done through the command `->setup`.

The bot is still in early development and still has a lot of bugs or features missing.
If you found a bug or have a nice feature request, be sure to head over to the Issues page and include as much info as you can in your issue!

Any contribution is welcome. I'm still a developer that's learning everyday so any piece of help is welcome :)  
  
  
  
*I'll make a nicer & more organised Readme soonTM*
